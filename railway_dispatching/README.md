# Railway Dispatching

This model is an example of a Railway Dispatching problem formulated as an optimization problem using the Gurobi Python 
API and solved with the Gurobi Optimizer. The model is based on our [2024 webinar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjlVY6Toxj0) about railway optimization.

This modeling example is at the advanced level, where we assume that you know Python and the Gurobi Python API and 
that you have advanced knowledge of building mathematical optimization models. Typically, the objective function and/or constraints of these examples are complex or require advanced features of the Gurobi Python API.
