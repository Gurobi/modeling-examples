    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "Picture Uber Eats, DoorDash, or Grubhub, but also local mom-and-pop restaurants with their own delivery.   \n",
    "Or consider home service providers that have skilled workers like landscapers, plumbers, or electricians.  \n",
    "Or how about home healthcare providers that send licensed professionals like nurses to patients' homes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do they all have in common?\n",
    "\n",
    "They all involve delivering goods or services. In these businesses, customers place orders and receive a delivery window from the provider (like when Amazon tells you that your overnight package will arrive between 7 am and 10 am). For service-based businesses, like needing a technician to fix something, customers might also provide an availability window (like, \"Can you come tomorrow afternoon, between 1 pm and 4 pm?\").\n",
    "\n",
    "In these diverse businesses, managing limited resources is the name of the game. Whether it's delivery vans, skilled workers, or even time itself, the challenge lies in allocating these limited resources optimally to achieve business goals."

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's delve into a specific scenario: You are consulting for a telecom company that dispatches technicians to perform various tasks for customers, ranging from equipment installations and setups to repairs. Each technician requires a service vehicle to travel to the job site. Here's what you're dealing with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The company offers various services, and not all technicians can perform all of them, so matching the right technician to the right job is crucial.\n",
    "- Service times (also known as process times) can vary for different jobs.\n",
    "- Customers provide windows of availability, and each customer is assigned to at most one technician (due to resource constraints).\n",
    "- Technicians have their own working hours. Not all of them work an 8-hour shift, and the job can't surpass these hours (no overtime allowed).\n",
    "- Technicians leave the service centers, complete their assigned jobs, and return to the center.\n",
    "- There are a limited number of vans at the service centers, equipped with the necessary tools. These vans are in shorter supply compared to technicians, and each technician needs a van to reach customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, basic rule-of-thumb approaches are used for scheduling customers one after another and assigning them to the technicians. Each technician is dispatched with a van as soon as their schedule is known. When a technician returns, the van is up for grabs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's explore how mathematical optimization can help with the allocation of these limited resources."

    "## Solution Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve this problem in two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Technician Routing\n",
    "This is a variation of the well-known vehicle routing problem (VRP) with time windows. The goal is to decide which technicians are assigned to which customers and in what sequence. This is modeled and solved in the [`technician_routing`](https://github.com/decision-spot/technician_assignment/blob/main/technician_routing.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model yields two outputs: \n",
    "- `routes` provides some information about each technician's feasible departure window from the service center and their total occupied time.\n",
    "- `orders` provides which customers (or orders) are assigned to which technicians and in what sequence (or in what order). A bit of fun with the file name!\n",
    "\n",
    "_Note:_ The `technician_routing` notebook is almost identical to Gurobi's [`technician_routing_scheduling`](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Gurobi/modeling-examples/blob/master/technician_routing_scheduling/technician_routing_scheduling.ipynb). Since an additional post processing step was required to export the results into csv files, and also some slight modifications in the constraints and objective functions needed to be made, a slightly different file name is used to differentiate between the two. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Resource Allocation\n",
    "Now that we know which technicians serve which customers, we can assign them to the available vans. This is the focus of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we optimize the allocation of limited resources, ensuring each technician has access to a van equipped with necessary tools to reach customers in time. We're looking at the big picture, reshuffling routes as needed, and making the most of our vans. If a technician can efficiently serve multiple customers, and a service van can be used multiple times per day, we're all in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's roll up our sleeves and optimize! 🚚🔧"

    "The length of each bar represents the duration from the start to the completion of a route. Because we have time windows (both earliest and latest times) for both the start and finish, each route is represented by two bars. One bar illustrates the route's duration if everything starts at the earliest times, and the other shows the duration if everything is delayed until the latest times. By comparing the starting points of these bars for each route, we can assess the schedule flexibility for each route.\n",
