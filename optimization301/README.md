# Optimization 301 for Data Scientists!

The material is from the [Optimization 301 for Data Scientists](https://whova.com/portal/webapp/Vti3dgwQi9Vkfd8AhCde/) training, which consists of two stets of hands-on modeling examples with exercises to help get from proof of concept to production.

You can review the Jupyter Notebooks here. For all examples, a completed version is available. If you want to test yourself and try out some of the exercises, you should start with the not-completed-versions of the notebooks and then compare with the completed versions.
