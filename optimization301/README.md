# Optimization 301 for Data Scientists!



The material is from the [Optimization 301 for Data Scientists](https://whova.com/portal/webapp/opti_202412/) training, which consists of two modeling examples and a culminating use case. 
You can review the Jupyter Notebooks here. For all examples, a completed version is available. If you want to test yourself and try out some of the exercises, you should start with the not-completed-versions of the notebooks and then compare with the completed versions.
