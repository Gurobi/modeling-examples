    "There are situations where a set of tasks share limited resources, meaning some tasks cannot be executed simultaneously because they depend on or compete for the same resource. We can model this as a compatibility graph, where each task is a node and an edge between two tasks indicates that they have no conflict and can run in parallel. If there is no edge between two tasks (i.e., no compatibility), they cannot both be in the solution. The goal is to find the largest subset of mutually compatible tasks; those that can all be performed at the same time without resource overlap. This is known as the _maximum clique problem_.\n",

    "# Other Cautionary Tales\n",
    "Here, we share additional examples, cautionary tales, and best practices to keep in your toolkit as you move from simple notebooks toward production-ready code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Failure After Project Handoff\n",
    "- If you can't have unit tests for your code, at least deliver it with a few small datasets (in text formats like CSV or JSON that are version-controlled) that run successfully with your model. These act as your basic tests.\n",
    "- If someone modifies the model and later reports an issue, you can rerun your small test dataset first to check whether it still passes. This helps you isolate whether the problem lies in the code or in the new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data-Specific Rules\n",
    "- It's rare to build a model that runs only once and on a single dataset. Different datasets may include their own rules or hidden constraints that aren't obvious at first.\n",
    "- Your model might run perfectly on one dataset and fail on another because of these differences.\n",
    "- **Test your model on multiple datasets that capture the diversity of the system you're modeling.**"
