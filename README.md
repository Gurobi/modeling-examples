## Target audience
Data scientists, engineers, computer scientists, economists, and in general, professionals with a background in mathematical modeling and a basic knowledge of Python.

## Goals of modeling examples
+ Illustrate the broad applicability of mathematical optimization.
+ Show how to build mathematical optimization models.

These modeling examples are coded using the Gurobi Python API and distributed as Jupyter Notebooks.

These modeling examples illustrate important capabilities of the Gurobi Python API, including adding decision variables, building linear expressions, adding constraints, and adding an objective function.
They touch on more advanced features such as generalized constraints, piecewise-linear functions, and multi-objective hierarchical optimization.  They also illustrate common constraint types such as “allocation constraints”, “balance constraints”, “sequencing constraints”, “precedence constraints”, and others.

The examples are from different business purposes and reflect different levels of building mathematical optimization models.

## Introductory examples

The introductory examples walk you through the process of building a mathematical optimization model.
The basic requirements are that you know Python and have a background in a discipline that uses quantitative methods.

It is also possible to browse through the examples w.r.t. difficulty level and business needs on the [Gurobi website](https://www.gurobi.com/jupyter_models/).


## Run on Google Colab

You can access all the examples in Google Colab, which is a free, online Jupyter Notebook environment that allows you to write and execute Python code through your browser. You will need to be signed into a Google account to execute the notebooks. 
But you do not need an account if you just want to look at the notebooks.
For each example, the respective colab link is given in the readme:
+ To run the example the first time, choose “Runtime” and then click “Run all”.
+ All the cells in the Jupyter Notebook will be executed.
+ The example will install the gurobipy package. The Gurobi
  pip package includes a size-limited trial license equivalent to the Gurobi "online course" license. For most of the notebooks, this restricted license is sufficient to run them. For others, you will need a full license, see the license section below.
+ You can also modify and re-run individual cells.
+ For subsequent runs, choose “Runtime” and click “Restart and run all”.
+ The Gurobi Optimizer will find the optimal solution of the modeling example.
Check out the [Colab Getting Started Guide](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#scrollTo=GJBs_flRovLc) for full details on how to use Colab Notebooks as well as create your own.

## Run locally

- Clone the repository containing all examples or download it
by clicking [here](https://github.com/Gurobi/modeling-examples/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
- [Start Jupyter Notebook Server](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/running.html#id2)
- Open the particular notebook in Jupyter Notebook. 
- The notebook will install the gurobipy package and other dependencies. The Gurobi
  pip package includes a size-limited trial license equivalent to the Gurobi "online course" license. For most of the notebooks, this restricted license is sufficient. For others, you will need a full license.

## Licensing

In order to run the Jupyter Notebooks you will need a Gurobi license. Most of the notebooks can be run using the "online course" license version of Gurobi. This is a limited license and restricts the number of allowed variables and constraints. This restricted license comes also with the gurobipy package when installing it via pip or conda.
You can also request a full license, i.e., an [evaluation license](https://www.gurobi.com/downloads/request-an-evaluation-license/) as a *commercial user*, or download a [free license](https://www.gurobi.com/academia/academic-program-and-licenses/) as an *academic user*. The latter two license types allow you to run all notebooks.
All licenses can also be requested in the [Gurobi User Portal](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/licenses/request/) after [registering for a Gurobi account](https://portal.gurobi.com/iam/register/).
