# Opti 202 Day 1 Exercises

## Problems
We revisit a problem from modeling sessions in Opti 101 and 201. Given demand data produced by a hypothetical machine learning model, as well as transportation costs and production capacity, determine the optimal production and shipment of widgets from a set of production facilities to distribution locations that minimize cost. 

We also take a deep dive into a nonlinear regression problem modeling **envyme kinetics**. 


## Beware Spoilers!
We also put **completed** versions of the modeling notebook and the exercise in the repo. If you want to work through the notebooks without everything filled in make sure not to open the completed versions.
