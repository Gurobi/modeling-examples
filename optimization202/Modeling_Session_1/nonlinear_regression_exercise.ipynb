    "Ready to dive into nonlinear regression? In nonlinear regression models, the relationship between the regression parameters and the outcome variable is nonlinear.

    "The goal of nonlinear regression is to find the parameters that minimize the model error, typically measured by the squared error between the model’s predictions,  $y(x_i; \\text{regression parameters})$ and the actual data points $y_i$. In optimization terms, this process involves:\n",
    "- **Decision variables**: The regression parameters (e.g., $a$ and $b$ in our example below) that define the model.\n",
    "- **Data**: The \"variables\" from the regression model (e.g., y(x) and x) become data points $y_i$ and $x_i$ for all data points $i$.\n",
    "- **Objective**: Commonly, we minimize the sum of the squared error between the model predictions $y_{\\rm model}(x_i; a, b)$ and observed values $y_i$.  Sometimes, absolute error is used as an alternative.\n",
    "- **Constraints**: Often, nonlinear regression has no natural constraints, though bounds can be set on parameters as needed. In this exercise we will, we define $y_{\\rm model}(x)$ to establish our objective.\n",

    "### Comparison to linear regression\n",
    "Linear regression is often the first and most widely used type of regression, where the relationship between parameters and the predicted value $y(x)$ is linear. For example:\n",
    "$$y(x) = a\\cdot x + b$$\n",
    "$$y(x) = a\\cdot x + b\\cdot z + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with terms like $x^2$ or $x\\cdot e^x$, a regression model can be trained using linear regression as long as the parameters ($a$, $b$, and $c$) are linear with respect to $y(x)$:\n",
    "$$y(x) = a\\cdot xz + b\\cdot x^2 + c\\cdot z$$\n",
    "$$y(x) = a\\cdot xe^x + b\\frac{1}{x} + c$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because, in the optimization model, the regression coefficients $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the actual variables, while the independent and dependent variables, $x$ and $y$ are simply data points rather than variables themselves. So, the use of the word 'variable' in this notebook can get a little tricky! To keep things clear, we’ll refer to the optimization variables as 'decision variables' wherever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression offers a closed-form solution, allowing parameters to be calculated directly—an advantage that makes it fast in tools like Excel, R, and Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonlinear regression, however, lacks this simplicity. Instead, we solve an optimization problem to find the parameters. Though more complex, this approach is essential for modeling curved or intricate data relationships, providing a flexible and accurate fit.\n"

    "[Michaelis-Menten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelis%E2%80%93Menten_kinetics) kinetics describes how quickly a reaction happens when an enzyme—a type of molecule that speeds up processes in the body or other reactions—interacts with other molecules. Initially, as the amount of molecules $x$ increases, the reaction speed, $y$, increases. But at a certain point, adding more molecules doesn’t increase the speed much because the enzyme is already working as fast as it can.\n",
