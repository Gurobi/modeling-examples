The material is from the [Optimization 202 for Data Scientists](https://www.gurobi.com/events/optimization-203-for-data-scientists/) training, which consists of two modeling examples and a culminating use case. 
You can review the Jupyter Notebooks here. For all examples, a completed version is available. If you want to test yourself and try out some of the exercises, you should start with the not-completed-versions of the notebooks and then compare with the completed versions.
