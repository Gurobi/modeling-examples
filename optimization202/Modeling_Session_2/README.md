# Opti 202 Day 2 Exercises

## Problems
We expand upon the now-classic widget problem **even more** by incorporting piecewise linear modeling, nonlinear components, and practical ways to deal with uncertainty. 

There is also a basic portfolio optimization problem that maximizes the worst case among three potential scenarios. 


## Beware Spoilers!
We also put **completed** versions of the modeling notebook and the exercise in the repo. If you want to work through the notebooks without everything filled in make sure not to open the completed versions.
