# Next-level Modeling! How Math Optimization & GenAI Work Together

Here you'll find two prompts used in the session, along with a blank template. 

Gurobi AI Modeling is a way for people new to mathematical optimization to learn how to model problems. It is made up of an in-depth [documentation site](https://gurobi-ai-modeling.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and a [configured version of ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-g69cy3XAp-gurobi-ai-modeling-assistant). 

If you're an experienced Gurobi user, check out [Gurobot](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-vPqYcfN7M-gurobot), which helps with optimization modeling, Gurobi API questions, and troubleshooting.
