# Emergency Supply Prepositioning Strategy (ESUPS) Case Study

To reduce gaps and overlaps in emergency preparedness, [ESUPS](https://esups.org/) promotes coordinated prepositioning of emergency supplies and collective logistics strategies.

## Problem
This model used a scenario-based transportation linear programming model with a probabalistic objective to show how to allocated resources at minimal expcted cost. Several important metrics are then derived to inform decision making. 

The goal is to decide:
- How much of each supply to store in certain locations
- And then how to respond to disaster events at minimal cost
