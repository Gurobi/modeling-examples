# Emergency Supply Prepositioning Strategy (ESUPS) Case Study

To reduce gaps and overlaps in emergency preparedness, [ESUPS](https://esups.org/) promotes coordinated prepositioning of emergency supplies and collective logistics strategies.

## Problem
By using scenario-based transportation linear programming model, the model resource allocation and logistics decisions, providing quantitative metrics to evaluate and improve humanitarian operations.

The goal is to decide:
- How much of each supply to store in certain locations
- How to respond to disaster events at minimal cost
