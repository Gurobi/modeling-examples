    "<h2> Introduction </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're familiar with fantasy basketball and worked through our **first example** you may have noticed that the lineup we solved for doesn't actually fit the criteria for many popular contests. It was meant as a ground-floor example into mathematical optimization, so make sure to dive into that one first for background on the problem. Additionally, we developed a predictive model to forecast each player's fantasy points, and we'll again use that forecast (without going through the modeling process again).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this follow-up example, we will extend the optimization model to fulfill the requirements of a typical [DraftKings](https://www.draftkings.com/help/rules/nba) lineup. Specifically, we'll need to change the model to:\n",
    "- Allow some players to be selected for up to two positions (e.g. LeBron James can fill the PF or SF position)\n",
    "- Increase the roster from five to eight players\n",
    "- Ensure the three new roster slots consist of one guard (SG or PG), one forward (SF or PF), and one utility player (any position)\n",
    "\n",
    "A quick recap of what we saw in the prior example: When selecting a 5-player lineup, there were *a lot* of possibilities; staying under a salary cap wasn't all that easy; and implementing intuitive decision rules can lead to suboptimal lineups -- providing a glimpse into why mathematical optimization should be part of everyone's analytics toolkit. \n",

    "<h2> Objective and Prerequisites </h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the first example, the goal here is to build upon our findings of the previous example and select the optimal lineup of players of the National Basketball Association (NBA) that would produce the highest total of fantasy points, which are composed of a player's in-game stats. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, we will make a lineup that meets DraftKings contest rules. There were over 2 million possible lineups when selecting a 5-player team that contained one of each position. Can you figure out the number of possible lineups for this example? Here's a hint: It's a lot. Remember that there are 25 PGs, 23 SFs, 22 SGs, 19 PFs, and 9 Cs. The answer (approximately) will be given a bit later. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also as mentioned, this example will use the same forecasting results as our fantasy basketball beginner's example, which used historical data from the 2016-2017 and 2017-2018 seasons to predict each player's fantasy points for games on 12/25/2017.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example assumes you have experience using Python for data manipulation and requires the installation of the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **pandas**: for data analysis and manipulation \n",
    "- **math**: for mathematical manipulations\n",
    "- **gurobipy**: for utilizing Gurobi to formulate and solve the optimization problem\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also explore a few different ways to write summations and constraints in gurobipy, so you can find what works best for you. A quick note: Any output you see similar to <gurobi.Constr \\*Awaiting Model Update\\*> can be ignored and semi-colons have been added to cells to suppress that output. "

    "<h2> Problem Statement and Solution Approach</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "By formuating a model that allows some players to be assigned to more than one position and by also expanding the roster, we are making the model much more complex.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Our final lineup needs to include each of the following:\n",
    "- Point Guard (PG)\n",
    "- Shooting Guard (SG)\n",
    "- Shooting Forward (SF)\n",
    "- Power Forward (PF)\n",
    "- Center (C)\n",
    "- Guard (SG,PG)\n",
    "- Forward (SF,PF)\n",
    "- Utility (PG, SG, SF, PF, C)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution of the problem consists of two components: 1) **fantasy points forecast** and 2) **lineup optimization**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by loading a dataset for the eligible players, showing their potential positions, salaries, as well as the forecasts for their upcoming performance. This information will act as an input to our optimization model which will guarantee that we satisfy the rules of the DraftKings contest while maximizing the total fantasy points of our team."

    "<h3> Fantasy Points Forecast </h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "This section will be short as we are using the output of the predictive model from the first part of this example. We'll see that in this version some players have a *Main Position* and *Alternative Position*, which will let players fill different position slots if eligible. For example, James Harden can fill the PG or SG position, though Russel Westbrook is only available as a PG.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by loading the necessary libraries to solve our problem and importing the data from the predictive model in part one of the problem. "

    "- Expanded the initial model to reflect the true complexity of creating a fantasy basketball lineup\n",
    "- Discovered multiple ways to add a set of constraints to a model\n",
    "- Utilized two summation commands\n",
    "- Used attributes of a model to get more information about the optimal solution\n",
