        "\n",
        "Linear regression was invented at the beginning of the 19th century and today, after more than 200 years, it is still used extensively in practical applications for description and prediction purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- In econometrics, it is useful to estimate the price elasticity of a particular product by regressing sales revenue on price and possibly other features such as demographics and competitor and retail information.\n",
        "- In health sciences, it can be applied to predict how long a patient will remain (i.e. length of stay) in the ER of a hospital based on patient information, triage assessment, medical test results, and the date/time of arrival.\n",
        "- In social sciences, it may shed light on future academic performance of students, so proactive measures can be taken to improve their learning outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, linear regression is used to model the relationship between a continuous variable and other explanatory variables, which can be either continuous or categorical. When applying this technique, finding the subset of features that maximizes its perfomance is often of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "## Problem Description\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear regression is a supervised learning algorithm used to predict a quantitative response. It assumes that there is a linear relationship between the feature vector $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ and the response $y_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. Mathematically speaking, for sample $i$ we have $y_i = \\beta^T x_i + \\epsilon_i$, where $\\beta \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ is the vector of feature weights, including the intercept, and  $\\epsilon_i$ is a normally-distributed random variable with zero mean and constant variance representing the error term. We can learn the weights from a training dataset with $n$ observations $\\{X \\in \\mathbb{M}^{nxd},y \\in \\mathbb{R}^n\\}$ by minimizing the Residual Sum of Squares (RSS): $e^Te =(y-X\\beta)^T (y-X\\beta)=\\beta^T X^T X\\beta- 2y^TX\\beta+y^T y$. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method achieves this by taking the derivative of this quadratic and convex function and then finding the stationary point: $\\beta_{OLS}=(X^T X)^{-1} X^T y$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, some of the features are in fact not associated with the response. By including them, we only add unnecessary complexity to the model and increase variance to the weight estimates. However, finding the best performing model is no simple task as there is an exponential number of candidates, as one has to test $\\sum_{s=1}^{d-1}{{d-1} \\choose s}$ models. Since OLS rarely yields estimates that are exactly zero, thus discarding the features related to them, we need to resort to feature selection methods. Popular methods include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Subset selection, e.g. stepwise selection.\n",
        "- Dimensionality reduction, e.g. principal component regression.\n",
        "- Shrinkage, e.g. the Lasso.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Lasso has undoubtedly been the method of choice for the last decade. Basically it fits a model containing all $d$ predictors, while incorporating a budget constraint based on the L1-norm of $\\beta$, disregarding the intercept component. In fact, this method minimizes the RSS, subject to $\\sum_{l=1}^{d-1}\\mathopen|\\beta_l\\mathclose| \\leq s$, where $s$ is a hyper-parameter representing the budget that is usually tuned via cross-validation. This constraint has the effect of shrinking all weight estimates, allowing some of them to be exactly zero when $s$ is small enough. Finally, it is worth noting that the unconstrained version of the Lasso is more frequently used. This version solves an unconstrained optimization problem where $RSS + \\lambda \\sum_{l=1}^{d-1}\\mathopen|\\beta_l\\mathclose|$ is minimized, for a given value of the —modified— lagrangian multiplier $\\lambda \\in \\mathbb{R}^+$.  \n",
        "\n",
        "A similar formulation is now presented, where the L0-norm is used instead (although it is not really a proper norm). We now seek to minimize the RSS, subject to $\\sum_{l=1}^{d-1}I(\\beta_l \\neq 0) \\leq s$, where $I(\\beta_l \\neq 0)$ is an indicator function taking on the value of 1 if $\\beta_j \\neq 0$ and 0 otherwise. In this setting, $s$ represents the number of features to consider in the model. This optimization problem may be casted as a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program (MIQP). Traditionally, the feature selection problem has not been tackled this way because of the common belief in the statistics community that large-scale problems are intractable. But this is no longer the case, considering the computing power currently available and the performance of modern optimization solvers such as Gurobi.\n",

However, we also need to find the value for $s$ that maximizes the performance of the regression on unseen observations. Notice that the training RSS decreases monotonically as more features are considered (which translates to relaxing the MIQP), so it is not advisable to use it as the performance metric. Instead, we will estimate the Mean Squared Error (MSE) via cross-validation. This metric is defined as $\\text{MSE}=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i-\\hat{y}_i)^2}$, where $y_i$ and $\\hat{y}_i$ are the observed and predicted values for the ith observation, respectively.

        "Notice that the Lasso performs poorly, as we did not standardize the features to be expressed in the same units (with an average of zero and variance of one). Contrary to OLS and L0-Regression, the Lasso is not scale-invariant because the budget constraint is based on the L1-norm. Remember that $\\beta_l$ is interpreted as the change in the response per unit-change of feature $l$. Since the L1-norm takes the sum of absolute values, how much of the budget $\\beta_l$ consumes depends on the units of measurement of the feature associated to it. \n",

        "3. Scale by dividing the resulting difference by $\\sigma_l$.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to report the performance of the Lasso after applying standardization, we need to perform hyper-parameter tuning on the L1-norm penalty via cross-validation. Unfortunately, we must not use the model class `LassoCV`. This is due to the fact that standardization is not supported, and doing that beforehand over the whole dataset would contaminate the folds. In order to prevent that from happening, we will perform random search as follows:"

This is due to the fact that the Lasso can retrieve the $\\beta_{OLS}$ estimate when the budget $s$ is big enough (alternatively, when $\\lambda$ is small enough). On the other hand, it is marginally worse than L0-Regression, mainly because by shrinking $\\beta$ we add bias to the estimates. Furthermore, observe that L0-Regression achieved the best performance with the fewest number of features. This is convenient, as it leads to a more interpretable model."

        "\n",
        "Since we standardized the data, the intercept represents the estimated median value (in thousands) of a house with mean values across features. Likewise, we can interpret $\\beta_1=-1.02$ as the decrease in the house value when the per-capita crime rate increases by one standard deviation from the average value, all other things being equal (similar statements can be made for the rest of the features). Finally, if the main purpose of the analysis is to explain the variability in the response, having 11 features may be too much. However, remember that one can always set the number of active features to a more manageable number to ease the interpretation, perhaps at the expense of predictive power.\n",

        "## Conclusions\n",
        "\n",
        "It has been shown how mathematical programming can be used to perform feature selection on linear regression problems. It is in fact a good alternative to the Lasso, given that L0-Regression is scale invariant and does not add bias to the weight estimates. Furthermore, this approach is amenable to the specification of additional linear constraints (Bertsimas, 2015), such as:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Enforcing group sparsity among features.\n",
        "- Limiting pairwise multicollinearity.\n",
        "- Limiting global multicollinearity.\n",
        "- Considering a fixed set of nonlinear transformations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nevertheless, take this result with caution, as \"there is no free lunch in statistics\". That is, no algorithm outperforms all others under all possible datasets. Ultimately, a good data scientist should consider multiple learning algorithms when analyzing a dataset.\n",
