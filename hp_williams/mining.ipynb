    "This model is an example of a production problem. In production planning problems, decisions must be made regarding which products to produce, and which resources to use to produce those products. These problems are common across a broad range of manufacturing and mining industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we will model and solve a multi-period production planning problem. In this case, the aim of the application is to optimize mine production across a number of mines over a five-year period. The company has different mines, which can be opened, operational, or closed. Each mine varies in the quality of its ore and the amount of ore that can be extracted. The quality of ore required to meet production goals varies each year. The aim is to create an optimal production plan for the next five years to maximize the total profit, while considering all production capacity, mine restrictions, and mine costs.\n",

    "## Problem Description\n",
    "\n",
    "A mining company needs to create a five-year operating plan for a certain area with four mines in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can only operate a maximum of three mines in this area in any given year. However, even though a mine may not operate in a given year, the company still must pay royalties on that mine in that year, if there is the expectation it will operate again in a future year. If a mine is not going to be operational again, then it can be permanently closed down and no more royalties need to be paid.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yearly royalties due for each open mine (operating or not) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Royalties |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Mine 1 | \\\\$5 Million |\n",
    "| Mine 2 | \\\\$4 Million |\n",
    "| Mine 3 | \\\\$4 Million |\n",
    "| Mine 4 | \\\\$5 Million |\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a maximum amount of ore that can be extracted from each mine in a given year. These limits are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Max Production |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Mine 1 | $2.0\\times10^6$ Tons |\n",
    "| Mine 2 | $2.5\\times10^6$ Tons |\n",
    "| Mine 3 | $1.3\\times10^6$ Tons |\n",
    "| Mine 4 | $3.0\\times10^6$ Tons |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each mine produces a different grade of ore. This grade is measured on a scale such that blending ores together results in a linear combination of the quality requirements. For example, if equal quantities of ore from two different mines were combined, the resulting ore would have a grade that is the average of the grade for each of the two ores that were combined. The grade for each mine’s ore is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Ore Quality |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Mine 1 | 1.0 |\n",
    "| Mine 2 | 0.7 |\n",
    "| Mine 3 | 1.5 |\n",
    "| Mine 4 | 0.5 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each year, the ore produced from each operating mine must be combined to produce ore of a certain grade. The yearly objectives for the combined ore are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| <i></i> | Quality Target |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| Year 1 | 0.9 |\n",
    "| Year 2 | 0.8 |\n",
    "| Year 3 | 1.2 |\n",
    "| Year 4 | 0.6 |\n",
    "| Year 5 | 1.0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "The final blended ore sells for \\\\$10/ton. Revenues and costs for future years are discounted at the rate of 10\\% per annum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question for the mining company is: Which mines should be operated each year and how much ore should be extracted from each mine?\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is based on a larger one faced by the firm of English China Clays, which had to in decide which mines to work. In that problem (in the 1970s), the goal was to work up to four mines out of 20 in each year.\n",
