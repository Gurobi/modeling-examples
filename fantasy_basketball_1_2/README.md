# Fantasy Basketball 

This example begins with NBA boxsxore data to build a supervised machine learning model that predicts players fantasy point output for a single days games.
Those predictions are then used in an optimization model that will select the optimal team consisting of one player from each of the five main positions. 

The second part expands the optimization model to reflect actual fantasy basketball competitions, shows different ways to model constraints, and 
introduces the *slack* of a constraint.
