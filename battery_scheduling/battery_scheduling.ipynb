    "#  Optimization Guide to Battery Scheduling with Gurobi\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a beginner-friendly introduction to battery scheduling using mathematical optimization and Gurobi. Basic knowledge about mathematical optimization and Python programming are required as taught in [Optimization 101 for Data Scientists](https://www.gurobi.com/events/optimization-101-for-data-scientists/) as well as the basics in battery energy management. The notebook is structured as follows: \n",
    "- First we introduce the battery scheduling problem in 3 different variants with increasing complexity.\n",
    "- Second we define example parameters for 3 days of battery operations. \n",
    "- Third we build the 3 different model variants in gurobipy.\n",
    "- Fourth we run the Gurobi Optimizer on a selected model.\n",
    "- Fifth we visualize the optimized battery operations schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The battery scheduling problem is about deciding when to charge and discharge a behind-the-meter battery to maximize profit (or minimize cost) given predictions of time-dependent electricity prices (tariffs). In this notebook, we also consider photovoltaic (PV) generation, and technical constraints of the battery.\n",

    "### Load & Generation (LG) Model\n",
    "We start very simple to set a baseline for the economic costs: Import electricity from the grid to compensate deficits resulting from a higher load than PV generation. Vice versa, export electricity to the grid if PV generates more power than the load is. There is no battery considered yet.\n",
