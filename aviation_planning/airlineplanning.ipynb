    "Let us say that on this day, there is a weather event (such as a snowstorm) that inhibits the airports from operating at full capacity. This means that some flights have to get cancelled. When a flight will be cancelled, the aircrafts assigned to these flights have to be re-routed. So the question becomes: how can airlines decide which flights to operate/cancel and how to best re-route the aircrafts? \n",

This dataset is based on flight plans for an airline in France. For this notebook, we have pre-processed this dataset and stored the information in three parts:\n",

    "- **Passenger itinerary:** The number of passengers and the price per ticket sold for each flight. This information is useful to assess the revenue brought in by each flight.\n",

    "- Besides cancelling flights, there are other ways to alter the schedule after a disruption, such as delaying a flight, rebooking the passengers onto other flights, etc. Can you model these using decision variables? What type of constraints are needed?\n",
    "- We only consider the cost of cancelling a flight. There may be other costs due to maintainance and repair, that we don't consider. How can other costs be incorporated into the model?\n",
    "- There are indirect considerations to crew planning that this model does not include. For example, when reserve crew misses a connection due to a flight cancellation, that crew won't be able to serve a future flight. Can crew planning be captured in the model as well? \n"
